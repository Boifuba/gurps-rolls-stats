|---------|-------------|
| `/stats` | Open the statistics dialog |
| `/stats reset` | Clear all recorded statistics (GM only) |
| `/stats settings` | Open the settings dialog |
| `/stats fullreset` | Complete module reset (GM only) |

### Chat Controls
The module adds two buttons to your chat interface:
- **Statistics Button**: Opens the main statistics dialog
- **Recording Toggle**:
  - **GM**: Controls global recording (all players)
  - **Players**: Controls personal recording (when global is enabled)

> Chat controls can be disabled in player settings

## Statistics Dialog

### Individual Player View
When viewing a specific player's statistics, you'll see:
- **Basic Metrics**: Total rolls, average roll, success/failure rates
- **Margin Analysis**: Average success and failure margins
- **Critical Outcomes**: Count of critical successes and failures
- **Attribute Data**: Total damage taken and fatigue spent
- **Distribution Chart**: Visual representation of roll distribution
- **Comparison Indicators**: How the player compares to global averages (â–²â–¼)

### All Players View
Shows combined statistics from all players with multi-series charts comparing different players' roll distributions.

## Rankings System

### Available Rankings
1. **Luckiest Players**: Most critical successes
2. **Unluckiest Players**: Most critical failures
3. **Best Success Rate**: Highest percentage of successful rolls
4. **Worst Success Rate**: Highest percentage of failed rolls
5. **Most Damage Taken**: Highest total HP damage received
6. **Most Fatigue Spent**: Highest total FP expenditure

### Using Rankings
1. Click the **Statistics** button
2. Select **"Show Rankings"**
3. View the 2x3 grid of top performers
4. Click **"Print Ranking to Chat"** to share complete rankings with all players

## "On Fire" Effect System

### How It Works
The "On Fire" system uses a 30-point progression system:
- **Success**: +1 point
- **Failure**: -1 point (or -21 points if currently "on fire")
- **Critical Success**: Instantly become "on fire" (30 points)
- **Critical Failure**: Lose all points

The visual counter shows 0-10 icons representing your progress (every 3 points = 1 icon).

### Visual Effects
When a player reaches 30 points (10 icons), they become "ON FIRE" with:
- **Animated borders** around their chat messages
- **Particle effects** (fire or electric based on theme)
- **Special notifications** announcing their status
- **Emoji counters** showing current level
- **Custom active text** in their name display

### Customization Options

#### GM Settings (Global)
- **Enable Counter (GM)**: Turn the entire system on/off
- **Enable Animation Effects (GM)**: Control visual animations globally
- **Effect Theme**: Choose between Fire ðŸ”¥ or Electric âš¡ themes
- **Full Bar Maximum Points**: Configure the point system (10-100 points)
- **Global Active Text**: Default message for players who haven't set their own

#### Player Settings (Individual)
- **Show Counters**: Display effect icons on your messages
- **Show Animation Effects**: Enable visual effects for yourself
- **Show Chat Controls**: Display statistics and recording buttons
- **Hide Effect Emojis**: Hide emojis while keeping the system active
- **My Personal Active Text**: Custom message when you're "on fire"
- **Pause My Rolls**: Temporarily stop recording your rolls

- Automatic detection of 3d6 rolls
- Success/failure status from GURPS system
- Margin of success/failure extraction
- Critical success/failure identification

### Roll Requirements
- Must be 3d6 rolls processed by GURPS system
- Must include success/failure determination
- Margin information is automatically extracted when available

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- **Foundry VTT**: Version 13+
- **SocketLib**: Required for multi-user effect synchronization
- **GURPS Game Aid**: Required for roll detection and parsing

### Compatibility
- **GURPS System**: Optimized for GURPS Game Aid (GGA)
- **Other Systems**: Not supported - designed specifically for GURPS

## Themes

### Fire Theme ðŸ”¥
- **Colors**: Warm reds, oranges, and yellows
- **Effects**: Floating ember particles with bouncing counters
- **Animation**: Pulsing borders and particle trails
- **Message**: "Player is ON FIRE!"

### Electric Theme âš¡

## Best Practices

### For GMs
1. **Configure globally** but let players control their individual experience
2. **Use "Hide GM Data"** to focus statistics on player performance
3. **Monitor attribute tracking** to see damage and fatigue patterns
4. **Use rankings** to create engaging competition between players
5. **Export charts** to share session highlights

### For Players
1. **Customize your display** preferences for optimal experience
2. **Set personal active text** to make your "on fire" status unique
3. **Use the pause feature** when making non-gameplay rolls
4. **Check your statistics** regularly to track improvement
5. **Monitor your damage/fatigue** to see gameplay patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Statistics not updating?**
- Check if recording is enabled (both globally and personally)
- Ensure rolls include success/failure information
- Verify the roll format is supported by GURPS Game Aid

**Effects not showing?**
- Check both GM global settings and your personal settings
- Both must be enabled for effects to display
- Try refreshing the page if effects seem stuck

**Charts not displaying?**
- Ensure you have roll data recorded
- Try selecting "All Players" if individual view is empty
- Check if "Hide GM Data" is filtering out all available data
- Check browser console for any errors

**Attribute tracking not working?**
- Verify that HP/FP changes are being made through the character sheet
- Check that the changes result in actual decreases (damage/fatigue)
- Ensure SocketLib is properly installed and active

### Performance Tips
- **Large datasets**: The module handles thousands of rolls efficiently
- **Memory usage**: Charts are optimized and don't impact game performance
- **Network**: Effects use SocketLib for efficient synchronization
- **Attribute tracking**: Uses efficient hooks to minimize performance impact

## Data Management

### Resetting Data
- **`/stats reset`**: Clear roll statistics only (GM only)
- **`/stats fullreset`**: Complete module reset including effects and settings (GM only)
- **Individual clearing**: Use settings to clear specific user effects

### Data Persistence
- All data is stored in Foundry's world settings
- Data persists between sessions
- No external database required
- Automatic cleanup of corrupted data on startup

## Advanced Features

### Multi-User Synchronization
- Real-time effect updates across all clients
- Synchronized fire status and animations
- Efficient network usage through SocketLib
- Immediate visual feedback on critical successes

### Responsive Design
- Charts adapt to different screen sizes
- Optimized for various Foundry themes
- Mobile-friendly interface elements

### Data Integrity
- Automatic validation of roll data
- Corruption detection and cleanup
- Safe migration between data formats
- Robust error handling

Thanks to Tuvulu for the idea â€” at first, I had no intention of making it, but you won me over with persistence!

*"May your rolls be ever in your favor!"*
