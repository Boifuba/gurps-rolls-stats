# To Do
1. Validate with the user.
2. Test in production.

# Maybe
1. Add a setting for the GM to choose whether the button appears in the chat bar or in the actions bar (right side).
2. Decide if each player should be able to pause their own rolls during tests.
3. Add a “on fire” visual effect to the token or HUD, granting 10× successes for X minutes or 1 critical for X minutes, where X is configurable in Settings.
4. Move the PNG export option to Settings.
5. Change each user’s color in the chart via Settings, or automatically use the color the user selected (currently unknown how to implement).
6. Optimize vertical space to avoid the scroll bar.

# Next Release
1. Log the session date to have individualized statistics.
2. Create a more fun dialog to show to everyone, with a short tune.
3. Explore other ways to analyze the data.
4. Add `/stats pause` and `/stats record` commands in case the buttons are removed.
5. Look for alternative chart options or styles that match Foundry’s aesthetics.
